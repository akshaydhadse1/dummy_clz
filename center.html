    <p style="text-indent: 40px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">It gives me an immense pleasure to throw some light on the background of the college.<br>
    The College was established in 1989 to provide the education to the poor and the needy students particularly with rural and tribal background. The vision behind establishing the college was to grow the moral grandeur and intellectual level of the students of the area. Ours is the rural college, where majority of the students is of backward classes. The mission is to provide financial assistance to the students of the backward classes by initiating various schemes to the best of our capacity. The chief objective of the college is to provide an opportunity of higher education for the students of rural area and specifically for female students.<br>
    True to its motto, <b>Ramrao Zanak Arts and Commerce College, Malegaon, is affiliated to Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University Amravati.</b> It always aspires to aim high, to attain great heights in its quest for excellence in imparting human, spiritual and moral information to the students. Facing so many impediments on the way to its growth, the college has progressed a lot. 

    <br>To bring betterment in the overall academic system of the institution, the college provides academic and personal counselling to each student on regular basis. The vital essence is to provide personal direction and developmental guidance. Counselling helps teachers to bond and develop better rapport with the students that helps them to cope with the problems of growing up, keep up with their studies and planning their careers....<a href="">read more
     Hard work, dedication and perseverance are the most important traits in a person that lead to success. The future belongs to you; your need, therefore, is to prepare yourself for an active participation in the world. This participation demands that you become well informed and hence develop yourself like a pioneer and ultimately grow as responsible men and women.
Students should always think and review – discover the cause and effect of every event, in which they are involved. Do not surrender or become a slave to youthful fancies and indulgences. Be steady in your studies. Learn to enjoy hard work – particularly your studies. Think wisely, think systematically. Always prepare yourself for next day’s lesson. Be very serious and attentive in class.
Preserve our heritage and environment for yourself as well as for your next generation. Always be a soldier to defend and preserve our traditions and our territory. I encourage all students to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the college and involve themselves in all the extra-curricular activities that are offered.
The overall development of the mind and body is a sign of a healthy & complete development. To develop the self is to build character and to prepare the self for complete realization.
1. To achieve mental development, training of senses and parts of the body should be given.
2. Reading should precede the teaching of writing.
3. More opportunities should be given for learning by doing.
4. Encouragement should be given to learning by experience.
5. Correlation should be established in the teaching methods and learning experiences.
